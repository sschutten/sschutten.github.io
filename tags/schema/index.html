They&rsquo;re very similar in that they execute the actions for each of the items in the array. There&rsquo;s one caveat though and that is the default concurrency setting.

One of the benefits of the Chromium based Edge is that it brings profiles to Edge. Profiles are great, because they allow you to have separate profiles for different purposes, e.g. a work profile and a personal profile.</p>

Doing so is not that easy. You need to manage state locally, synchronize changed data (one-way or duplex) and maybe even handle conflicts. Luckily Microsoft offers the Sync Framework which makes it easier for you to accomplish this by taking much of the required plumbing out of your hands completely.</p>

        <p class="card-text post-summary">The Windows Phone 7 SDK contains a couple of APIs for interacting with different parts of the phone hardware, like accessing the camera or initiating a phone call. One of the cool APIs of Windows Phone 7 is the Location API. Just as in the desktop version of .NET Framework 4.0, the Location API enables you to get the approximate location of the user. To find the location of the user, the API uses GPS, WiFi or cell tower triangulation, where the first is the most and the latter least accurate.</p>

        <p class="card-text post-summary">Just released (oh well, a couple of months ago), the long awaited BizTalk Server 2006 extensions for Windows Workflow Foundation SDK. Use WF modeling and host workflows in BizTalk Server. Note the BTS messaging activities in the image.
The new BizTalk Server edition will most likely sport the Workflow Designer instead of the plain old Orchestration Designer. This probably results into something that looks a lot like what you get with the extentions.</p>

The parsing of the string as a DateTime is not the real problem here. Once you know how the string is formatted it is simply writing a way to parse it, either using substrings or using the DateTime.Parse method. Once you have a DateTime though, you need to format it to be valid according to the XSD spec.</p>

        <p class="card-text post-summary">For beginners BizTalk can be really difficult to learn. They don’t know how to perform certain tasks and are stunned by a lot of (for them) cryptical warnings and errors. Luckily there’s the BizTalk Troubleshooting Guide which covers most (if not all) of the tasks, messages, tips, trics, know-hows and what else. Even for an experienced BizTalk enthousiast like me it contains a lot of interesting stuff. Use it as your BizTalk bible.</p>

        <p class="card-text post-summary">Sometimes the requirement for your BizTalk solution is to receive a flat file (read: not xml) in your orchestration an do something with the data. An example could be receiving a PDF file and extracting some portions of data out of it. Some BizTalk developers already know that you can receive whatever file without treating it as XML by using System.Xml.XmlDocument as its message type (sounds silly doesn’t it?). After you’ve received the message you can’t access it as you normally do because it’s still a byte stream.</p>

Most of the time I’m using this method on projects, but it introduces problems in BizTalk farms because you need to keep the configuration in sync. Another way would be to use a database, but that still requires a connection string to be present somewhere (again the BTSNTSvc.</p>

For XP one could develop plug-ins in the form of simple HTML pages, so it would always look as if the plug-in was bolted onto the side. Vista, in return, makes use of the eXtensible Markup Language defined with Windows Presentation Foundation.</p>

The HTML Generator Stylesheet for BizTalk 2004 Maps is an XSLT which transforms the data of a map into viewable HTML. Although the approach is a good one, I’m not really sure about the added value. I don’t think the rendered HTML pages are very readable as there’s a lot of textual information on them.</p>

        <p class="card-text post-summary">Just recently I was looking for some default message properties and how to read and write them inside a custom pipeline component. While searching I stumbled over a great post listing all the default message properties and how to read them.
If you want to access the properties in your custom pipeline component, you have to get the IBaseMessageContext object from the IBaseContext and use the Read method to get a value or theWrite method to substitute a value with your own.</p>

        <p class="card-text post-summary">I’ve just watched a clip from Channel9 featuring Eddie Churchill. In the video he demonstrates a prototype of the future BizTalk mapper. The new mapper will contain some very impressive features as I must say. Some of them make the life of the mapper a lot easier, especially when dealing with large maps.
Some of the features which are shown in the video are:
 Different drawing densities for lines which are in view and which aren’t.</p>

The new workflow designer that Workflow Foundation features will substitute the good ol’ orchestration designer in BizTalk vNext. This means that in the near future BizTalk Server and Workflow Foundation will grow to each other and will make a very strong team in delivering high available and reliable business solution.</p>

        <p class="card-text post-summary">A few weeks ago Kevin Smith (UK MCS Service Line Architect) released the second version of BizUnit. BizUnit is a framework for the automation of functional and regression testing of BizTalk solutions. Just think of NUnit ;).
The .MSI can be downloaded here: http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/bizunit
It has a number of enhancements over the previous version that you can read about here: http://blogs.msdn.com/kevinsmi/archive/2005/07/17/439728.aspx.
BizUnit can be used in conjunction with Jason Births ‘Orchestration Profiler’ to ensure that a solution has an adequate level of test coverage allowing it to be deployed with confidence.</p>
