Today I found out that my article on BAM for the Dutch .Net Magazine of december 2006 is published online. Itâ€™s an introduction to BAM and I wrote it because I think BAM is far underused at the moment.

If you understand Dutch you might want to check it out [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/3/9/e3968dfc-2196-41eb-9134-bebf7ce62237/DNM15_p66-69_101.pdf).

 Ex-collegue Dick Dijkstra also wrote an article for the same edition of the .Net Magazine. His article is about the new and improved error handling methods in BizTalk Server 2006. You can find his article [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/3/9/e3968dfc-2196-41eb-9134-bebf7ce62237/DNM15_p12-15_107.pdf) (also Dutch).
