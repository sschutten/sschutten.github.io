Mike McKeown has a [great blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/biztalk_adapter_development/default.aspx) where he elaborates on BizTalk Adapter development. He has some nice tutorials, howto’s and whitepapers listed on his blog. Some time ago he released a [BizTalk Adapter developent whitepaper](http://blogs.msdn.com/biztalk_adapter_development/archive/2006/05/16/599216.aspx) regarding transactional adapters and adapter base classes. You should definetely read this if you’re involved in developing new adapters. Also don’t forget to read his other material.
