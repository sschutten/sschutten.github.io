Tomas Restrepo wrote a [really useful framework](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2006/04/27/PipelineTestingLibraryPart1.aspx) to test pipelines and pipeline components. Some time ago he released the first version of his framework and posted a couple of howto’s to get you started. It’s definitely worth stopping by his blog.
