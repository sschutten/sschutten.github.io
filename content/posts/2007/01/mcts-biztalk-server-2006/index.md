Today I passed the [70-235 exam](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-235.mspx), required for earning the [MCTS BizTalk Server 2006 certification](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/biztalk/default.mspx). About 20% of the questions was related to the Business Rule Engine (BRE) and another 15% to Business Activity Monitoring (BAM). The other questions were all general BizTalk questions, including some questions on Role Links. I found the exam a little difficult, mainly because I haven’t worked with the BRE that much and also haven’t used Role Links. Luckily I took the [BizTalk 2006 Deep Dive course](http://www.quicklearn.com/class.aspx?class=BTSDD) by [QuickLearn](http://www.quicklearn.com), which gave me the basic knowledge on these subjects.
