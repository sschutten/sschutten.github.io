[![](/images/xccube.jpg "xccube")](/images/xccube.jpg)On this page I want te describe my hobby regarding Home Theater PCs (HTPC). I built my first HTPC in december 2005 and I used the AOpen XC Cube barebone to do it. This resulted in a small and quiet HTPC and I enjoyed it for about a year. Then came the moment I was moving to another house and I wanted to use the opportunity to buy a new LCD TV. But to enjoy the new TV in it’s full glory I also wanted to have digital TV. Because the XC Cube didn’t have the extra space I needed I thought it was time for a new HTPC.

My new HTPC started with the new enclosure. My previous HTPC stood somewhere in a corner of my bedroom, but my new HTPC was going to get a prominent place in the livingroom. Therefor I was looking for an enclosure with Hifi proportions so it is the same size as an amplifier. My search finally led me to the LC16M Silverstone casing because it looked great, had enough space and was not as expensive as it competitors.
