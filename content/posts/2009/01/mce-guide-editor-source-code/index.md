I got a few requests for the source code of MCE Guide Editor. I once started working on a new release of it and during the process I discovered that the solution I chose wasn’t going to work. This meant I didn’t have the source of the working version of the tool. What I did was disassemble the executable. I’m currently working on a Windows 7 PC, so I wasn’t able to compile the disassembled code because I’m missing the ehome dll. However, people who know what to do with source code can easily fix the problems that are in there.

Feel free to do with it what you like. If you managed to improve it or made it work on XP or Win7, please drop me a line. Get it below.
