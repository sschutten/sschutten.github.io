Almost every BizTalk artifact is beautifully documentable, especially using the [BizTalk Documenter](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=41c1faa9-13a6-478b-af81-d87ca946a222). One thing that’s always hard to document are the maps. Finally someone came up with a solution and that someone is Steve Hart.

The [HTML Generator Stylesheet for BizTalk 2004 Maps ](http://www.hartsteve.com/?p=23)is an XSLT which transforms the data of a map into viewable HTML. Although the approach is a good one, I’m not really sure about the added value. I don’t think the rendered HTML pages are very readable as there’s a lot of textual information on them. I think it’ll always be difficult to document a map, but maybe if it is presented in a more graphical and readable way it’s more useful. I’ll just wait for the next version.
