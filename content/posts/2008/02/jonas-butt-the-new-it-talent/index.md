IT-talent is an internship project which offers IT-talents an exclusive assignment with a prominent IT company. The goal is to create an unique experience and a solid basis for a successful career in IT. Check out [www.it-talenten.nl](http://www.it-talenten.nl) (Dutch) for more information on this project.

One of the eight participating students is [Jonas Butt](http://www.ittalentenblog.nl/archives/entry_60.php), who’s doing his internship at Avanade Netherlands. During his internship he’ll try to answer the following research question:

*How can Avanade promote the reuse of products (like code, patterns and domain knowledge) from similar projects within the same domain to reduce costs and shorten the run time?*

If Jonas manages to make his blog the most interesting and entertaining of all eight he’ll be awarded the IT-talent of the year award. For more information please continue to read [his blog](http://www.ittalentenblog.nl/student7.php).
