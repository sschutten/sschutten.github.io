For about 5 months now I’m running with a couple of friends. We started out with a small route in the woods, but that got a little too dark in the winter. One time I was running right behind one of my fellow runners and I couln’t see anything but his white shoes. Suddenly I noticed the path was way to our right and we were standing somewhere in the middle of some schrubs. We then decided it was time for a new route. We found that route near the woods we used to run. Since then we expanded it to be around 7 kilometers in length. Our last record is about 41 minutes and today we’ll try to beat that. Below an image of the route.
