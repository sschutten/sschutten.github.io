Today I witnessed the arrival of eight Avanade branded Fiat 500 cars. They arrived in a single line in front of our main office, where they stand now. The orange / black color combination draws a lot of attention and enthousiasm. Together with the branding and racing stripes they form the perfect car for our core services team. Secretly, in our hearts, the customer facing employees, driving our big luxurous lease cars, would die to drive one of these babies ourselves.
