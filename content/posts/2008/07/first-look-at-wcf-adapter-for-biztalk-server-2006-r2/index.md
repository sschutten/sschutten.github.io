Although the WCF adapter for BizTalk Server 2006 R2 has been released a while ago, I found that a coworker of mine had created a simple and short video explaining all the basics of using the WCF adapter. If you havenâ€™t used the adapter before or just want to see how easy it is to use the adapter, go see the video [here](http://www.biztalkgurus.com/Liveplay/WCFFirstLook/WCF_FirstLook_Video.aspx).
