I heard it from collegues who went to the PDC a couple of weeks ago. But I heard it myself at the BPI & Workflow conference earlier this october. The new workflow designer that Workflow Foundation features will substitute the good olâ€™ orchestration designer in BizTalk vNext. This means that in the near future BizTalk Server and Workflow Foundation will grow to each other and will make a very strong team in delivering high available and reliable business solution. If only I could fastforward a couple of years!
