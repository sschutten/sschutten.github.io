Aaah! I’ve read some very good news today. For some time now, I’m looking into developing plug-ins for XP Media Center, but I dislike the way it works. It looks like with Vista all my dreams will come true!

For XP one could develop plug-ins in the form of simple HTML pages, so it would always look as if the plug-in was bolted onto the side. Vista, in return, makes use of the eXtensible Markup Language defined with Windows Presentation Foundation. This enables the developer to create plug-ins that would seamlessly integrate with the product, using all of the same cool graphic effects!

The upcoming week I’ll prepare my Media Center machine (which also acts as webserver for this blog) to upgrade to Vista Media Center. I’ll post my findings here.
