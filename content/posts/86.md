[](File URL) [](/images/homeserverbook.jpg) [![](/images/homeserverbook-150x150.jpg "homeserverbook")](/images/homeserverbook.jpg)in case you haven’t seen this yet, Microsoft has a rather interesting marketing campaign around Windows Home Server. One of the parts of the campaign is a book about Home Server which looks like it’s written for kids. The book explains what the magic 'Server' in the house is all about.

Microsoft went so far with this campaign that it actually looks like you can [buy the book ](http://www.amazon.com/Mommy-Why-There-Server-House/dp/160530641X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1200003350&sr=8-1)from Amazon! Absolutely hilarious!

If you would like to know more about that weird ‘Server’ that suddenly appeared in your house and what it does, you should definitely [read the book](http://gizmodo.com/photogallery/microserveces08)!
