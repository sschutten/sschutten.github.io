Today I released the first edition of MCE Guide Editor. I created this tool because of the very long list of channels I got since I use satellite tv. Reordering the channels is a real pain in the ass if you use the Media Center user interface. Here’s where MCE Guide Editor comes in…

MCE Guide Editor allows you to change the order of channels of your Media Center setup in an easy way, using drag and drop. This tool also allow you to exclude channels from appearing in Media Center, thus making the list of channels smaller.

Note: use this tool at your own risk. MCE Guide Editor has been tested on the Dutch version of Vista Media Center.

Any feedback is really appreciated.

So, what are you waiting for? Download it now!
