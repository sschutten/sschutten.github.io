Today I joined the web-log community and will, as many others, post my personal opinions and findings on various subjects, but specificly BizTalk Server. I’m an Avanade consultant working in the Netherlands and specialized in business process integration using BizTalk Server. This means a lot of information on this blog will be about BizTalk. Aside from that I’ll also keep you updated on some of my hobby’s like Windows Media Center, XBOX360 and whatever else comes to mind.

Because I wanted to start blogging sooner I already have some stuff lying around which I want to put up here. So, in the coming couple of days I will submit there posts which will get me up to speed!
