This March the DevDays are coming to Amsterdam and I will be there to speak on BizTalk Server 2006 together with collegae Matt Joe, who is flown in from Seattle. I will be doing some demos involving BAM and in-order processing.

Matt will also be accompanying [Dennis Mulder](http://www.dennismulder.net/blog) in a very promising talk on Windows Workflow Foundation.

Last but not least my manager Edwin Jongsma will enlighten everyone on the subject of Software Factories (Domain Specific Languages).

The Agenda for the DevDays looks as follows:

- 7 March: Dennis Mulder and Matt Joe on Windows Workflow Foundation
- 7 March: Edwin Jongsma on Software Factories
- 8 March: I (Sander Schutten) and Matt Joe on BizTalk Server 2006

I hope to see you there!
