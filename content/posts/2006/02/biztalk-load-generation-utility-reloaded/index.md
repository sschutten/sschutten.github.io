The BizTalk load generation utility, originally released by Microsoft several months ago, was quickly removed from their downloads page for enhancement. The enhanced version is now available for download [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C2EE632B-41C2-42B4-B865-34077F483C9E&displaylang=en).

The interesting part is that this tool works with the Performance Tester Tool of Larry Beck (see post below).
