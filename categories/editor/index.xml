I once started working on a new release of it and during the process I discovered that the solution I chose wasn’t going to work. This meant I didn’t have the source of the working version of the tool. What I did was disassemble the executable. I’m currently working on a Windows 7 PC, so I wasn’t able to compile the disassembled code because I’m missing the ehome dll.</description></item></channel></rss>
