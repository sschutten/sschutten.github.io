      <description>A lot has been said and written about Windows Phone 7 Mango. The eagerly awaited update to Microsoft’s new Windows Phone platform is said to sport 500 new features, bringing it up to par with its competition. While 500 features sound a lot, it may well be achieved if you count every little detail. Many of the bigger features can be found all over the web, especially in the much detailed Engadget in-depth preview.</description>

      <description>For a mobile platform, like Windows Phone 7, you may be required to allow an application to work even when there’s no data connection available. Doing so is not that easy. You need to manage state locally, synchronize changed data (one-way or duplex) and maybe even handle conflicts. Luckily Microsoft offers the Sync Framework which makes it easier for you to accomplish this by taking much of the required plumbing out of your hands completely.</description>
