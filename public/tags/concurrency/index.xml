      <description>Microsoft Flow and Azure Logic Apps are based on the same platform and therefor very similar. There are, however, cases where they&amp;rsquo;re a little different. Take for example the Apply to each (Flow) action and the For each (Logic Apps) action. They&amp;rsquo;re very similar in that they execute the actions for each of the items in the array. There&amp;rsquo;s one caveat though and that is the default concurrency setting.
