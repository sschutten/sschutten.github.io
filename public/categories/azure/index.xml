      <description>I must say that Logic Apps has come a long way in its brief lifetime. It&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly easy to get up and go with Logic Apps and the number of available connectors is crazy.

      <description>During my day job I regularly had to use virtual machines to do my work on. It just simply isn&amp;rsquo;t convenient to run BizTalk Server or SharePoint on you laptop. I&amp;rsquo;ve used many types and brands of virtualisation software like Virtual PC, Virtual Server and VMWare. More recently I started using Hyper-V, which, because baked into Windows 8, sounds like a very natural thing to do.
Unfortunately, whatever software I used, the performance I get just doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a good user experience.</description>
